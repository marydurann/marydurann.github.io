  <h1>From First-Gen to Future Marketer</h1>

  <p>Breaking into the business world isn’t easy—especially as a first-generation college student. I struggled to find my path, unsure how to connect classroom lessons with real-world opportunities. Without mentors in the field, I often felt like I was one step behind in understanding how marketing, technology, and data could work together.</p>

  <p>But I turned that challenge into motivation. I’m now pursuing a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing at the University of Northern Colorado, along with a Digital Marketing certificate and a minor in Spanish. I’ve built skills in Excel, Tableau, and Qualtrics, and I’m passionate about helping brands grow through data-driven strategy and creative content. My journey proves that with determination and the right tools, you can turn barriers into breakthroughs.</p>
